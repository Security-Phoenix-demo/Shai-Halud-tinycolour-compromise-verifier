# Requirements for NPM Package Compromise Detection Tools - 2025 Extended Edition
# No external dependencies required - uses only Python standard library

# The Python script uses only built-in modules:
# - json (for parsing package.json and configuration files)
# - os (for file system operations)
# - re (for pattern matching)
# - sys (for system operations and exit codes)
# - subprocess (for running npm/yarn commands)
# - pathlib (for path operations)
# - argparse (for command line argument parsing)
# - datetime (for timestamps)
# - tempfile (for temporary files)
# - shutil (for file operations)

# Optional: If you want to add additional features, you might consider:
# requests>=2.25.0  # For fetching latest package information from npm registry
# colorama>=0.4.4   # For cross-platform colored terminal output
# tabulate>=0.8.9   # For better formatted table output

# For shell script, the following system tools are required:
# - bash (shell interpreter)
# - jq (JSON processor) - install with: sudo apt-get install jq (Ubuntu/Debian) or brew install jq (macOS)
# - find (file search utility) - usually pre-installed
# - grep (text search utility) - usually pre-installed

# Note: The Python script is designed to work with Python 3.6+ without any external dependencies
# to ensure maximum compatibility and ease of deployment in security-critical environments.
